# About me

Sérgio Carvalho is currently a data scientist at the Raízen Energia Company located in the city of Piracicaba - SP - Brazil. My passion for science came about through the reading of science and science fiction books by such authors as Isaac Asimov and Arhur C. Clarke. Among his hobbies are math, classical guitar, chess, movies, chats with friends and many hours of fun with his son Rayan.
